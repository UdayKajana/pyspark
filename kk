Look in previous log entries for the cause of each one of the 4 failures. If the logs only contain generic timeout errors related to accessing external resources, such as MongoDB, verify that the worker service account has permission to access the resource's subnetwork. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/common-errors. The work item was attempted on these workers: 

      Root cause: Timed out waiting for an update from the worker.
